## Background
Primarily due to privacy policy, social media companies like facebook or instagram cannot keep the chats or activity history of its users. Doing so, social media platforms loses an enourmous amount of data that they can use to obtain valuable insights. To overcome such issue we are going to select any one social media (Whatsapp in our case) and export the chats between two users and instead of keeping the chat, we are going to keep an essence of what the chat was conveying and do analysis over it.
